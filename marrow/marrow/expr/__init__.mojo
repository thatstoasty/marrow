"""marrow.expr — expression and logical plan system.

Scalar expressions
------------------
``AnyValue``    — type-erased scalar expression node (ArcPointer-backed)
``Value``       — trait every scalar expression node must implement

Concrete scalar nodes: ``Column``, ``Literal``, ``Binary``, ``Unary``,
``IsNull``, ``IfElse``, ``Cast``

Factory functions: ``col()``, ``lit()``, ``if_else()``
Utilities: ``rebuild()``, ``resolve_columns()``
Operator overloads: ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``,
``<=``, ``==``, ``!=``, ``&``, ``|``, ``~``, unary ``-``

Relational plans
----------------
``AnyRelation`` — type-erased relational plan node
``Relation``    — trait every relational plan node must implement

Concrete plan nodes: ``Scan``, ``Filter``, ``Project``, ``InMemoryTable``,
``ParquetScan``
Plan-building: ``AnyRelation.select()``, ``AnyRelation.filter()``
Factory: ``in_memory_table()``, ``parquet_scan()``

Rewriting
---------
``Rewrite``    — trait for non-destructive rewrite rules
``AnyRewrite`` — type-erased rule container
``Rewriter``   — bottom-up fixed-point rewrite driver
